My name is Sharat Visweswara, I live in Seattle and I design and build software at [Evocalize](https://evocalize.com). Prior to that I spent ~10 years building software systems at Amazon.

I mostly work on backend systems and focus on data integrity, system scalability and engineering productivity. I have deep expertise in relational databases and multi-tier architectures. I constantly encourage my team to build tools that make their lives easier and that tool-building is as important as product-building for long-term team productivity.

You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharatvisweswara/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/sharatvisweswara).
