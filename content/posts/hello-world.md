It is so incredibly easy to set up a personal blog now. I've picked:

* the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.
* the [XMin](https://xmin.yihui.org) theme to go with that.
* and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting.

The process is explained in this [Quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and the [Hosting on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) guide. I spent about 20 minutes setting this up, and more than that trying to pick a theme.

Happy Blogging!
